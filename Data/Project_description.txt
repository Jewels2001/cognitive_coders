This project focuses on developing a method for the artificial generation of electroencephalogram (EEG) data to expand research possibilities in cognitive science and machine learning. Current studies on brain wave data often involve real-time collection, pairing recorded brain activity with specific images or spoken words. However, the scarcity of accessible EEG datasets limits broader research. This project proposes a novel approach to reversing the typical data flow by training machine learning models on images and words to predict brain wave patterns based on pre-existing data.

By utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this method aims to simulate EEG outputs that correspond to various cognitive stimuli. Users can select file locations, choose synthetic EEG data corresponding to specific mental tasks (e.g., right or left brain activity), and generate the data for download and analysis. The synthetic data can be plotted and incorporated into diverse machine learning applications.

This tool will be a significant asset for researchers, allowing the creation of large-scale, high-quality EEG datasets without the need for extensive and costly data collection. The synthetic EEG data can be used for training and validating new algorithms, enhancing research in fields like neural interfaces, cognitive modeling, and brain-computer interaction. By leveraging this system, the project aims to bridge the gap between limited real-world EEG data and the growing demand for advanced, data-driven neuroscience research.
